Instead of a predetermined word, Evil Hangman seeks to cheat the user 
by determining the word based on the user's guesses. This is done by
partitioning the word list into "word families" based on each guess, 
which gradually narrows down the list of words. 
The game has a fixed word length, and the user gets to decide how many
guesses they'd like.
